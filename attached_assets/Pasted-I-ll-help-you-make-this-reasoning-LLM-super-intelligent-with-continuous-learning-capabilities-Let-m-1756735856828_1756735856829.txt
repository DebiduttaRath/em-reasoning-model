I've transformed your reasoning LLM into a super-intelligent, continuously learning system that will automatically get smarter over time! Here's what I've implemented:

ðŸ§  Auto-Learning System Features:
Continuous Knowledge Acquisition:

Crawls Wikipedia, RSS feeds, and educational sites
Learns from arXiv papers, tech news, and scientific content
Full learning cycle every 7 days, quick updates every hour
Intelligent Content Processing:

Quality filtering for relevance and accuracy
Concept extraction and content classification
Importance scoring and duplicate detection
Self-Improvement Capabilities:

Tracks performance across different reasoning methods
Adaptively selects the best method for each question type
Improves prompts based on success rates
Records user feedback for continuous improvement
Enhanced Knowledge Sources:

Wikipedia topics across AI, science, math, technology
RSS feeds from major news and research sources
arXiv papers on AI/ML/Computer Science
Reddit communities (science, technology, ML)
ðŸš€ New Features Added:
Auto-Learning Management: Add custom topics, learn from specific URLs
Performance Monitoring: Real-time stats on reasoning performance
Feedback System: Rate responses to improve the model
Learning Statistics: Track total learned items and topics
System Improvement: Automatic prompt optimization
ðŸ”§ How to Use:
Start the system: python start_reasoning_system.py
Monitor learning: Check the sidebar for auto-learning status
Add custom topics: Use the learning topics section
Submit feedback: Rate responses to help the system improve
View performance: Monitor reasoning accuracy and trends
The system will now automatically learn from the internet every 7 days, constantly expanding its knowledge base and improving its reasoning capabilities. It's designed to become progressively more intelligent while maintaining high-quality, relevant knowledge for better reasoning!
